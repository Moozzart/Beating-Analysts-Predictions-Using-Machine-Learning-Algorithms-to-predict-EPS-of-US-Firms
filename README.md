# Beating-Analysts-Predictions-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-to-predict-EPS-of-US-Firms
## Task
To develop a model to predict the earnings per share of firms using macroeconomic and company fundamentals. And to test its predictive power against the analystâ€™s predictions.

## Data Used 
Extracted from IBES. Macroeconomic variables were taken from FRED. And since the data used is really large, I'm attaching my drive link of the data here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dxpd89Pqjwy1U_upZvYjZR7vNejEKvLf?usp=sharing
